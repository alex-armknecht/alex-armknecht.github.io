          <ul>
            <li>
              <br>
               I am a student enrolled in Loyola Marymount University's Class of 2024, 
               currently pursuing a major in Computer Science with a specialized focus on Artificial Intelligence, 
               complemented by a minor in Interactive Gaming and Immersive Media. My love for programming dates 
               back to my middle school days, where I successfully advocated for the introduction of a computer science
               course. Throughout high school, my commitment to computer science deepened, and I discovered a passion for 
               sharing knowledge by volunteering to teach 4th graders the fundamentals of computer science. This affection 
               for helping others transferred into my college career when I became a TA for other CS students. College 
               life also continued to fuel my coding passion, and I work best in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
               I realized that my love for computer science was rooted in my love of creation and I found a parallel passion for 
               video game development and animation. Competent in both Unreal Engine and Adobe Animate, I enjoy the intersection 
               between technology and artistry. Whether collaborating within a team or pursuing individual projects, my ultimate 
               fulfillment lies in meaningful connections with others. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy reading, video games, 
               camping, skiing, skateboarding, football, stand-up comedy, and playing board games with friends.

              Party Finder, my final project in mobile app development, caters to college students. 
              The app allows users to discover nearby parties, RSVP, view live party ratings, and report 
              inappropriate users to ensure a safe enviroment. Despite its lighthearted nature, Party Finder
               integrates multiple APIs, connects to Firebase, and was voted the best app idea in the class.

              For my Cognitive Systems course, I developed a Pac-Man AI in a capture-the-flag environment exercise.
               Trained with approximate Q-learning over numerous iterations, the agent has a defensive strategy 
               patrolling the border and an offensive strategy collecting pellets and returning them to home base. 
                 In the class tournament, my Pac-Man agent earned second place. <br> Check out the code

              Escape, my final project in Advanced Animation using Unreal Engine 5, 
              immerses the player in a scenario where they must navigate through a hotel,
               solving a series of puzzles to break free from multiple rooms and hallways. 
               The project involves both the design and construction of the environment and 
               the fine-tuning of mechanics and puzzles.

              I served as the front-end developer for Briefcase, a continuing senior project in collaboration with the 
              Innocence Project. Our app utilizes AI to analyze and summarize court transcripts,
               aiding lawyers in reviewing cases of the wrongfully incarcerated. Briefcase seamlessly integrates PDF 
               transcript files, providing a digital platform with analysis features, collaboration tools, and 
               intuitive user navigation.

              In my Languages and Automata course, my team and I developed YeeHaw, a cowboy-themed 
              programming language designed for beginners to grasp logic concepts comfortably. YeeHaw is a statically 
              typed and inferred language, following an object-oriented programming paradigm. The language features 
              southern hospitality-inspired error messages to aid the learning experience.
