              In life's fleeting dance, a phrase takes its chance, YOLO whispers boldly, 
          an existential trance. One chance to tread this cosmic sphere, Carpe diem echoes, 
          dispelling fear. A moment's breath, a heartbeat's choice, YOLO, a resounding, 
          liberated voice. Embrace the now, the highs, the lows, Cherish every step, as the
          river flows. No script to follow, no rewind, no replay, YOLO guides us through the 
          fleeting day. In risks we find the colors of our soul, A vibrant tapestry, YOLO's tale 
          unfolds. Seize the echoes, let adventure unfold, For in YOLO's embrace, life's stories are told.

              Party Finder, my final project in mobile app development, caters to college students. 
              The app allows users to discover nearby parties, RSVP, view live party ratings, and report 
              inappropriate users to ensure a safe enviroment. Despite its lighthearted nature, Party Finder
               integrates multiple APIs, connects to Firebase, and was voted the best app idea in the class.

              For my Cognitive Systems course, I developed a Pac-Man AI as a capture-the-flag esc exercise.
               Trained with approximate Q-learning over numerous iterations, the agent had a defensive strategy 
               patrolling the border and an offensive strategy collecting pellets and returning them to home base. 
                 In the class tournament, my Pac-Man agent earned second place. <br> Check out the code

              Escape, my final project in Advanced Animation using Unreal Engine 5, 
              immerses the player in a captivating scenario where they must navigate through a hotel,
               solving a series of puzzles to break free from multiple rooms and hallways. 
               The entire project, from designing and constructing the environment to fine-tuning
                mechanics and puzzles, was accomplished within a month.

              I served as the front-end developer for Briefcase, a continuing senior project in collaboration with the 
              Innocence Project. Our app utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze and summarize court transcripts,
               aiding lawyers in reviewing cases of the wrongfully incarcerated. Briefcase seamlessly integrates PDF 
               transcript files, providing a digital platform with analysis features, collaboration tools, and 
               intuitive navigation for enhanced user interaction.

              In my junior year Languages and Automata course, my team and I developed YeeHaw, a cowboy-themed 
              programming language designed for beginners to grasp logic concepts comfortably. YeeHaw is a statically 
              typed and inferred language, following an object-oriented programming paradigm. The language features 
              southern hospitality-inspired error messages to enhance the learning experience.
